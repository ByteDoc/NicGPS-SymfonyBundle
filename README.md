====================

a **Personal Information Portal** and an **OpenUI5 Learning Project**  
Tracking of tasks at <https://trello.com/b/DARllx4G/ui5-meets-symfony-nic-gps>

## Use Case

This application provides easy access to a set of information, including a dashboard, for personal information management. The "target user" of this application is my lovely wife, Nicole, therefore the given example data entities reflect parts of her needs and interests.

## Technical Purpose

The development of this app is also a big opportunity for me to gain experience in OpenUI5 development. I tried to follow the recommendations for UI5 app structuring, but might not have accomplished this goal everywhere. Also, a few code experiments here and there can be found as well.

## Requirement and Configuration

  - OpenUI5 - get it here: <http://sap.github.io/openui5/>
    - adjust the source-path for *sap.ui.core.js* in index.html accordingly
  - PHP4/5 to read/save the JSON data files
    - for local testing JSON files are read without PHP scripts (no saving though)
  - Symfony - <http://www.symfony.com>
    - previous standalone version at <https://github.com/ByteDoc/NicGPS>
